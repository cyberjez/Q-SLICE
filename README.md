# Q-SLICE
Q-SLICE is a modular quantum adversarial simulation framework designed to model and measure quantum threats. Built with Qiskit, the harness runs targeted tests including Grover amplification, Shor’s factoring, BB84 key exchange, RNG bias injection, Bell state disruption, and noise-based coherence drift.
